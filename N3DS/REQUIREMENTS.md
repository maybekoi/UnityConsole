# REQUIREMENTS

1. First you're gonna need Unity 2017 with 3DS Build Support, NDI, and CTR SDK which can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/unity-2017-3ds-sdk_202308_202308) or Unity 5 with 3DS Build Support, NDI, and CTR SDK which can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/unity-for-3-ds).
2. Second, you're gonna need a code editor, I personally use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), but any editor can work.

That should be all (I think).
