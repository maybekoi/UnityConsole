# What you need to know about Unity for the Nintendo Switch!

### Input

* Unlike Unity for N3DS all of the input is handled via the built in Unity Input Manager so you don't have to fully hardcode everything, if you DO want to hardcode the input look at [this](extra/CONTROLS.md)

### Touch Screen Input

* It SHOULD automatically work out of the box and it shouldn't require any extra setup unlike the 3DS.

### Templates

* There will eventually be template projects in the Templates folder.


## Unity 2021+

* If you're on Unity 2021+ you'll need Repack4Retail from https://github.com/maybekoi/SwitchTools
